Purpose
---
The	purpose	of this assignment is to allow us to experiment with various uninformed search algorithms by programming blind and informed search in the Robot cleaner problem. It will include a representation of the world, an algorithm for search, and the	observation	of some metrics associated with the	search algorithms we used.

Description
---
The roomba appears in a randomly-generated room, represented by our Grid class, and must use a given search algorithm to clean all the dirt piles using a set of Actions with associated Action costs, while minimizing the total cost of the Path taken to achieve a valid solution.

How to Run
---
Build with "javac RobotApp.java" in Console.
Run "java RobotApp" and follow onscreen instructions.
